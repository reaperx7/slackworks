# slackworks
My public repository of SlackBuilds and other Slackware related projects.

This repository contains some of the software I personally use on my Slackware systems. Most of it is unofficial packages with custom patches and updates outside of the Slackware -Current trees.

Why Slackworks? Think of the U.S. Military's "skunkworks", and apply it to a Slackware stylization of a collective of projects that are possibly more up-to-date than what is normally found. Plus, the name makes sense. Slackworks could even mean "Slackware works". I leave that for you to decide.
